            <h2 class="question-title">What Is the Impact of Vaccination in India?</h2>
            <p class="answer">
                India has made significant strides in vaccination coverage over the years. The government’s Universal Immunization Program (UIP) aims to provide free vaccination to children against diseases like polio, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and more. 
                This has resulted in the near-eradication of polio in India, with the country being declared polio-free by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2014.

        <section class="question" id="importance_india">
            <h2 class="question-title">Why Are Vaccines Important in India?</h2>
            <p class="answer">
                India, with its vast population, faces challenges like poor sanitation and crowded living conditions, which make it more vulnerable to infectious diseases. Vaccines help reduce the spread of diseases and prevent outbreaks. 
                The immunization coverage in India has dramatically improved over the years, leading to a decrease in childhood mortality rates.
